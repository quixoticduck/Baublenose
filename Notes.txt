To do:
Make it so either the wink/honk noise does not sound when on mobile? maybe swap between?
Set volume property in javascript so the honk is not so loud https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33747398/html-audio-tag-volume

Issues:
hover audio only works after one click
nose remains orange on smartphones because the last clicked place is still seen as hovering. Try using Element: touchend event to fix - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchend_event

for main calendar website:
to make calendar days grid work on mobile use newish terms:
css aspect ratio
grid gap css
font size scale viewport width units 5 (%)

Done:
Add ding noise when winking
Change wink so it is only for when mouseisover
